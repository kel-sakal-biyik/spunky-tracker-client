# spunky-tracker-client

Here we will create a small application to track Spunky's gps location and barking.

It will consist of two components. One to measure how noise he makes, and another one to track his movement to 
see if he runs around too much.

We will use angular-cli to create our application and bootstrap it. So we need to install it first

Run `npm install -g @angular/cli`

Done? Ok cool now we can create our application by running:

`ng new spunky-tracker-client --skip-git -dir ./`

Here we have an initial setup to start creating our components. Let's see if it is running

`ng serve`

_If anything goes wrong checkout to next branch: `git checkout app-setup` _
