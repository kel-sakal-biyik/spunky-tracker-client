In the light of the steps that we completed, now you will try to create Location Meter component and complete our application.

Location Meter should:

* Query the location part of our schema
* Display the location change in an interface (It is up to you to decide how to show it. Be creative. You can use available
material components shown [here](https://material.angular.io/components). Don't forget to import new material components in
your `app.module.ts`)
* Show and update goToBed sound count
 
In trouble: `git checkout location-meter`
